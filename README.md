# british_airways_reviews_sentiment_analysis
In this project, the goal to is to analyse reviews from passengers who took the flight and shared their experience. 
To get a fairly representative sample, I scraped 100 pages of reviews from https://www.airlinequality.com/ , focusing solely on airline reviews of British Airways
Scraped data was messy, and this was cleaned with python, and stored as a text file. 
Sentiment analysis using nltk library was carried out to see the score of the data cleaned data.
